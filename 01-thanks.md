Huge thanks to my wife, for encouraging me to write this book, for also putting up with my late nights so I can focus on making this book a reality.

Thanks to my kids, for bursting into my work space throughout the day to give me hugs and to put a smile on my face. Your mere existence constantly pushes me to become a better person.

Finally, a thanks to you, the reader of this book. Thanks for taking the time to read through my work. I hope this guide will get you up and running with Jekyll quickly so you can focus on making awesome websites.
