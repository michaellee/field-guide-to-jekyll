# :book: A field guide to Jekyll

This repository contains the source of a book once written but never finished about the static-site generator, Jekyll. You can find out more about [why the book never got finished here](https://michaelsoolee.com/bye-project/).

**This repo is not actively maintained.**

**As this repo isn't actively maintained the contents may be outdated, please follow with caution.**

A great Jekyll resource is the [official documentation found on the Jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).
