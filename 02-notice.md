The information in this guide is for informational purposes only.

Technology is always moving at lightning speeds, therefore the information in this guide at any point may be irrelevant. This may include program, software or package versions that are written in this book. Please make sure to check program, software or package versions before running any commands.

Being a setup guide in nature, this book contains a lot of commands to run in a Terminal environment. The commands in this book are used to install programs, software or packages on your machine. I've done my best to research and provide the most accurate information possible in ensuring that these programs, software or packages are installed properly on macOS or Ubuntu. My assumptions are that these programs, software or packages have never been installed on your machine.

Since everyone's operating system setup can be different from one another, if any issues arise I can't be held responsible if something goes awry with the installation process. If something does go awry, make sure to check that you used the provided command accurately. In most cases if you run into an error, doing a simple Google search should provide a solution.
